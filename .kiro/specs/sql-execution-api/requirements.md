# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a SQL execution API endpoint that allows clients to execute validated SQL queries against the DuckDB database and receive structured results. The endpoint serves as the core query execution layer for the dashly application, enabling natural language to SQL translation results to be executed safely against the ingested data. The feature includes SQL validation, query execution, performance monitoring, and optional query cost estimation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dashly frontend application, I want to execute SQL queries through an API endpoint, so that I can retrieve data for dashboard generation based on natural language queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a POST request to `/api/execute` with JSON payload `{"sql": "SELECT ..."}` THEN the system SHALL validate the SQL query against security rules
2. WHEN the SQL query is valid THEN the system SHALL execute it against the DuckDB database
3. WHEN query execution succeeds THEN the system SHALL return JSON response with format `{"columns": [name,...], "rows": [[...],...], "row_count": N, "runtime_ms": ...}`
4. WHEN query execution fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error details including the specific failure reason
5. WHEN the request contains invalid JSON or missing sql field THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 422 with validation error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious system, I want to enforce strict SQL validation rules, so that only safe read-only queries can be executed against the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SQL validation is performed THEN the system SHALL only allow SELECT statements
2. WHEN SQL validation is performed THEN the system SHALL reject any DDL operations (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, etc.)
3. WHEN SQL validation is performed THEN the system SHALL reject any DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
4. WHEN SQL validation is performed THEN the system SHALL reject any administrative commands (PRAGMA, ATTACH, etc.)
5. WHEN an invalid SQL query is submitted THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with specific validation error message
6. WHEN SQL contains potentially dangerous patterns THEN the system SHALL reject the query with appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want query performance monitoring, so that I can track execution times and identify slow queries for optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any SQL query is executed THEN the system SHALL measure and return the execution time in milliseconds
2. WHEN query execution time exceeds a configurable threshold THEN the system SHALL log a performance warning
3. WHEN query results are returned THEN the response SHALL include the actual row count returned
4. WHEN query execution is monitored THEN the system SHALL track both successful and failed query attempts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want query cost estimation capabilities, so that I can prevent expensive queries from consuming excessive resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a GET request to `/api/execute/explain` with query parameter `sql` THEN the system SHALL return query execution plan without executing the query
2. WHEN query explanation is requested THEN the system SHALL use DuckDB's EXPLAIN functionality to analyze the query
3. WHEN query explanation succeeds THEN the system SHALL return JSON with estimated cost, execution plan, and resource requirements
4. WHEN query explanation fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with explanation error details
5. WHEN query is too complex for explanation THEN the system SHALL return appropriate warning message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that clients receive clear feedback about query execution failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SQL syntax errors occur THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with specific syntax error details and position
2. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 with database connectivity error
3. WHEN query execution times out THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 408 with timeout error message
4. WHEN query references non-existent tables or columns THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with schema error details
5. WHEN any server error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the full error details while returning safe error messages to clients

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious system, I want query execution limits, so that long-running queries don't impact system responsiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN query execution time exceeds 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL terminate the query and return timeout error
2. WHEN query result set exceeds 10,000 rows THEN the system SHALL limit results and include truncation warning
3. WHEN multiple concurrent queries are executing THEN the system SHALL queue additional requests to prevent resource exhaustion
4. WHEN query memory usage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL terminate the query with resource limit error

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for the SQL execution functionality, so that I can verify the API works correctly and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL test the `/api/execute` endpoint with valid SELECT queries
2. WHEN security tests run THEN they SHALL verify that DDL and DML queries are properly rejected
3. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL verify that execution time is measured and returned correctly
4. WHEN error handling tests run THEN they SHALL verify appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
5. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL test query execution against actual DuckDB data
6. WHEN tests are implemented THEN they SHALL use pytest as the testing framework and achieve high code coverage

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the SQL execution API to work seamlessly with existing database connections, so that it leverages the current DuckDB setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SQL execution endpoint is implemented THEN it SHALL reuse the existing DuckDB connection from the main application
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL use the same database file path as other endpoints
3. WHEN connection pooling is available THEN the system SHALL utilize it for concurrent query execution
4. WHEN database schema changes occur THEN the SQL execution endpoint SHALL automatically work with updated schemas
