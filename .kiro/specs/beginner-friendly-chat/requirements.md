# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature redesigns the chat system to create a beginner-friendly conversational interface for data analysis. The system will hide technical complexity (SQL queries, execution details) from users and provide a natural, conversational experience similar to chatting with Claude. Users will ask questions in plain English about their data, and the system will respond conversationally while automatically updating dashboards when appropriate.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analysis beginner, I want to ask questions about my data in plain English, so that I can get insights without needing to understand SQL or technical details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a natural language question THEN the system SHALL accept the input without requiring any SQL knowledge
2. WHEN a user asks a data question THEN the system SHALL process the request entirely in the backend without exposing technical details
3. WHEN the backend processes a query THEN the system SHALL return only the final answer in conversational language
4. IF a question cannot be answered THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance in plain English

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a beginner user, I want the chat interface to feel like talking to a knowledgeable assistant, so that I feel comfortable exploring my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system responds THEN it SHALL use conversational, friendly language
2. WHEN providing data insights THEN the system SHALL explain findings in business terms rather than technical terms
3. WHEN suggesting follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL phrase them in natural language
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL explain what went wrong in beginner-friendly terms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user asking data questions, I want the dashboard to automatically update with relevant visualizations, so that I can see the data behind the answers without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a question results in data that can be visualized THEN the system SHALL automatically add appropriate charts to the dashboard
2. WHEN updating the dashboard THEN the system SHALL choose the most suitable chart type based on the data
3. WHEN adding visualizations THEN the system SHALL provide a brief explanation of what the chart shows
4. IF no visualization is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a text-only response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a beginner, I want the system to guide me toward asking better questions about my data, so that I can discover more insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a vague question THEN the system SHALL suggest more specific alternatives
2. WHEN providing an answer THEN the system SHALL suggest related questions the user might find interesting
3. WHEN a user uploads new data THEN the system SHALL proactively suggest initial questions to explore
4. WHEN the system detects interesting patterns THEN it SHALL mention them conversationally

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat history to be preserved and easily accessible, so that I can refer back to previous insights and build on them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks questions THEN the system SHALL maintain a persistent chat history
2. WHEN referring to previous questions THEN the system SHALL understand context from the conversation
3. WHEN a user returns to the app THEN the system SHALL restore the previous chat session
4. WHEN the chat gets long THEN the system SHALL provide ways to navigate or summarize the conversation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle my questions quickly and provide feedback during processing, so that I know the system is working on my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a question THEN the system SHALL immediately show that it's processing
2. WHEN processing takes time THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators or status updates
3. WHEN the system is thinking THEN it SHALL show typing indicators similar to messaging apps
4. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition to showing the response

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a beginner, I want the system to work with my existing data without requiring me to understand database schemas or technical setup, so that I can focus on getting insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has uploaded CSV data THEN the system SHALL automatically understand the available data structure
2. WHEN a user asks about data that doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL explain what data is available in simple terms
3. WHEN the system references data columns THEN it SHALL use business-friendly names rather than technical column names
