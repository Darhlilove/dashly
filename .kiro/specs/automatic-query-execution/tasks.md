  - Modify handleQuery method to support automatic execution flow
  - Create new executeQueryAutomatically method that combines translation and execution
  - Add execution mode state management and persistence
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 3. Update conversation pane to display SQL and execution status

  - Enhance ConversationPane component to render SQL code blocks in messages
  - Add execution status indicators (pending, executing, completed, failed)
  - Implement loading states for automatic execution in conversation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 4. Create AdvancedModeToggle component for manual review option

  - Build toggle component with clear labeling and accessibility
  - Integrate toggle into main interface (conversation pane or header)
  - Add mode persistence using existing user preferences system
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 5. Implement enhanced error handling for automatic execution

  - Create user-friendly error message formatting for conversation display
  - Add error recovery suggestions and retry mechanisms
  - Update error handling to work within conversation flow instead of modals
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 6. Update API service for automatic execution flow

  - Add executeQueryAutomatically method to ApiService class
  - Enhance error handling to provide user-friendly messages
  - Ensure caching integration works with automatic execution
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [x] 7. Modify SQLPreviewModal to work conditionally with advanced mode

  - Update modal display logic to only show in advanced mode
  - Ensure existing manual execution functionality remains unchanged
  - Add proper state management for mode switching
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.5, 7.3_

- [x] 8. Implement execution status messaging and feedback

  - Add execution time and row count display in conversation
  - Create smooth loading transitions during automatic execution
  - Implement success messages with query results summary
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 9. Ensure dashboard integration works with automatic execution

  - Verify chart rendering works seamlessly with automatic execution
  - Maintain dashboard saving functionality after automatic execution
  - Test loading saved dashboards with automatic execution enabled
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [x] 10. Add comprehensive unit tests for automatic execution

  - Write tests for App component automatic execution flow
  - Test ConversationPane SQL display and execution status rendering
  - Create tests for AdvancedModeToggle component functionality
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.5_

- [x] 11. Implement integration tests for end-to-end automatic execution

  - Test complete flow from natural language query to dashboard display
  - Verify error handling scenarios in automatic execution mode
  - Test mode switching between automatic and advanced modes
  - _Requirements: 8.2, 8.3, 8.5_

- [x] 12. Add performance monitoring and optimization for automatic execution
  - Ensure execution time measurement works with automatic flow
  - Verify caching performance with automatic execution
  - Add performance monitoring for the new automatic execution pipeline
  - _Requirements: 6.4, 8.4_
