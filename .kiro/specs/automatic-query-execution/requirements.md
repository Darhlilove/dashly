# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature eliminates the manual SQL approval step in the dashly application by automatically executing generated SQL queries and displaying results immediately. Currently, users must review and manually approve generated SQL queries before execution, which creates friction for non-technical users who don't understand SQL. This improvement streamlines the user experience by removing the intermediate approval step while maintaining safety through existing SQL validation mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dashly user, I want the system to automatically execute generated SQL queries, so that I can see my dashboard results immediately without needing to understand or approve SQL code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a natural language query is successfully translated to SQL THEN the system SHALL automatically execute the SQL query without user intervention
2. WHEN automatic execution occurs THEN the system SHALL skip displaying the SQLPreviewModal component
3. WHEN automatic execution succeeds THEN the system SHALL immediately display the dashboard results with appropriate charts or tables
4. WHEN automatic execution fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow the user to retry with a different query
5. WHEN the system executes queries automatically THEN it SHALL still apply all existing SQL validation and security rules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a dashly user, I want to see the generated SQL query for reference, so that I can understand what data is being retrieved even though I don't need to approve it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query is automatically executed THEN the system SHALL display the generated SQL in the conversation pane as part of the assistant's response
2. WHEN SQL is displayed in the conversation THEN it SHALL be formatted as a code block for readability
3. WHEN the assistant shows SQL THEN it SHALL include a brief explanation of what the query does in plain language
4. WHEN SQL is shown THEN the system SHALL NOT require any user action to proceed with execution
5. WHEN users want to see the SQL THEN it SHALL be easily visible in the chat history without opening additional modals

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a dashly user, I want smooth loading states during automatic execution, so that I understand the system is processing my request and see progress feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automatic query execution begins THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator in the conversation pane
2. WHEN execution is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a message like "Executing query and generating your dashboard..."
3. WHEN execution completes successfully THEN the system SHALL show a success message with execution time and row count
4. WHEN the dashboard is being rendered THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states in the dashboard area
5. WHEN all processing is complete THEN the system SHALL remove all loading indicators and show the final results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a dashly user, I want clear error handling during automatic execution, so that I can understand what went wrong and know how to proceed if queries fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SQL generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message in the conversation pane explaining the translation failure
2. WHEN SQL execution fails THEN the system SHALL show the SQL validation error in user-friendly language
3. WHEN execution errors occur THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative ways to phrase the query
4. WHEN errors happen THEN the system SHALL NOT show the SQLPreviewModal but keep the conversation flow intact
5. WHEN users encounter errors THEN they SHALL be able to immediately try a new query without additional steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a power user, I want an optional way to review SQL before execution, so that I can still inspect and modify queries when needed for complex analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system provides automatic execution THEN it SHALL include an optional "Review SQL" or "Advanced Mode" toggle in the interface
2. WHEN advanced mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL show the SQLPreviewModal for manual review and editing
3. WHEN advanced mode is disabled (default) THEN the system SHALL execute queries automatically
4. WHEN users toggle advanced mode THEN the preference SHALL be remembered for their session
5. WHEN in advanced mode THEN all existing SQL preview and editing functionality SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the automatic execution feature to integrate seamlessly with existing caching and performance monitoring, so that the system maintains good performance and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queries are executed automatically THEN the system SHALL use existing query result caching mechanisms
2. WHEN cached results are available THEN the system SHALL use them and indicate "Using cached results" in the conversation
3. WHEN automatic execution occurs THEN the system SHALL still measure and report query execution times
4. WHEN performance monitoring is active THEN automatic execution SHALL be tracked the same as manual execution
5. WHEN the system uses caching THEN users SHALL see faster response times for repeated queries

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a dashly user, I want automatic execution to work with all existing dashboard features, so that I can still save dashboards, load saved dashboards, and use all current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queries are executed automatically THEN the system SHALL still enable dashboard saving functionality
2. WHEN automatic execution completes THEN the "Save Dashboard" button SHALL be available and functional
3. WHEN loading saved dashboards THEN the system SHALL continue to work as before without requiring manual SQL approval
4. WHEN chart type selection occurs THEN automatic execution SHALL use the same chart selection logic as manual execution
5. WHEN dashboard features are used THEN automatic execution SHALL not break any existing functionality

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for automatic execution, so that the feature works reliably and doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automatic execution tests are implemented THEN they SHALL verify that SQL queries are executed without showing the modal
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL test the complete flow from natural language to dashboard display
3. WHEN error handling tests run THEN they SHALL verify appropriate error messages are shown in the conversation pane
4. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL verify that automatic execution doesn't negatively impact response times
5. WHEN regression tests run THEN they SHALL ensure existing manual execution mode (advanced mode) still works correctly
