# UI Layout Improvements Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines improvements to the dashly application's user interface layout to enhance user experience through better space utilization, responsive design, and intuitive navigation. The changes focus on optimizing the chat/dashboard split view, implementing auto-hiding sidebar functionality, and providing flexible data visualization options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Resizable Chat and Dashboard Panes

**User Story:** As a user, I want to adjust the size of the chat and dashboard panes so that I can optimize my workspace based on my current task focus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is in chat/dashboard mode THEN the chat pane SHALL occupy 1/6 of the screen width and the dashboard pane SHALL occupy 5/6 of the screen width by default on desktop and tablet screens
2. WHEN a user drags the divider between chat and dashboard panes THEN the system SHALL allow resizing with smooth visual feedback
3. WHEN the user resizes the panes THEN the system SHALL maintain the new proportions until the user changes them again
4. WHEN the screen size is mobile THEN the system SHALL stack the panes vertically or provide a toggle between views
5. WHEN the panes are resized THEN both chat and dashboard content SHALL remain fully functional and properly formatted

### Requirement 2: Auto-hiding Sidebar with Hover Activation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidebar to automatically hide when I'm working with data so that I have maximum screen space for analysis, but I want easy access when I move my cursor to the left edge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is in chat/dashboard mode THEN the sidebar SHALL be hidden by default
2. WHEN the user moves their cursor to the left 20 pixels of the screen THEN the sidebar SHALL slide in smoothly within 200ms
3. WHEN the user moves their cursor away from the sidebar area THEN the sidebar SHALL slide out after a 1-second delay
4. WHEN the sidebar is visible THEN it SHALL overlay the content without shifting the layout
5. WHEN the sidebar appears THEN it SHALL maintain all its original functionality (dashboard list, new dashboard button, etc.)
6. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the sidebar SHALL use a different activation method (tap/swipe) instead of hover

### Requirement 3: Default Table View and Dashboard/Data Toggle

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my uploaded data in a table format by default so that I can immediately understand the data structure, and I want to easily switch between dashboard visualizations and raw data view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is successfully uploaded and no analysis has been performed THEN the dashboard pane SHALL display the data in a table format
2. WHEN the table is displayed THEN it SHALL show column headers, data types, and a reasonable number of rows (with pagination if needed)
3. WHEN dashboard visualizations are available THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle control to switch between "Dashboard" and "Data" views
4. WHEN the user clicks the "Dashboard" toggle THEN the system SHALL display the current chart/visualization
5. WHEN the user clicks the "Data" toggle THEN the system SHALL display the raw data table
6. WHEN switching between views THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and maintain the current state
7. WHEN no dashboards exist THEN the toggle SHALL be hidden and only the data table SHALL be shown
8. WHEN the table has many rows THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling or pagination for performance

### Requirement 4: Responsive Layout Behavior

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to work well on different screen sizes so that I can use dashly effectively on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen width is greater than 1024px THEN the system SHALL use the desktop layout with resizable panes
2. WHEN the screen width is between 768px and 1024px THEN the system SHALL use the tablet layout with adjusted proportions
3. WHEN the screen width is less than 768px THEN the system SHALL use a mobile-optimized layout
4. WHEN on mobile THEN the chat and dashboard SHALL be accessible through tabs or a slide-over interface
5. WHEN the orientation changes on mobile/tablet THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately

### Requirement 5: Smooth Animations and Visual Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth transitions and clear visual feedback so that the interface feels responsive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar slides in/out THEN the animation SHALL complete within 200ms with an easing function
2. WHEN panes are resized THEN the resize SHALL be smooth without flickering or layout jumps
3. WHEN switching between dashboard and data views THEN the transition SHALL include a subtle fade or slide effect
4. WHEN the cursor approaches the sidebar trigger area THEN there SHALL be a subtle visual indicator
5. WHEN animations are disabled by user preference or system settings THEN all transitions SHALL respect the reduced motion preference
