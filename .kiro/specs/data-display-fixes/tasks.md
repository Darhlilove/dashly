# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Debug and fix CSV data display in table view

  - Investigate the data flow from upload endpoint to DataTableView component
  - Fix data format issues preventing proper table display after CSV upload
  - Ensure upload response includes preview data for immediate display
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Implement proper view state separation

  - Create ViewStateManager service to handle data vs dashboard state separation
  - Modify DashboardWorkspace to maintain separate states for data and dashboard views
  - Ensure chat responses only update dashboard state, never data table state
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Fix chat response routing to prevent data table override

  - Update ConversationInterface to route responses to correct view
  - Implement automatic view switching when chat creates visualizations
  - Make sure the visualization is shown in the dashboard pane and not in the chat.
  - Add state preservation logic to prevent data loss during view switches
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 2.7_

- [x] 4. Enhance ResponseGenerator for conversational responses

  - Improve response generation to create human-readable insights instead of technical messages
  - Implement business-friendly number formatting (e.g., "$49K" instead of "49319.84999999")
  - Add meaningful data analysis and trend identification
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 5. Implement intelligent response formatting

  - Create structured response format with key findings and insights
  - Add chart explanation generation when visualizations are created
  - Implement context-aware follow-up question generation
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 6. Add comprehensive error handling and user guidance

  - Implement fallback responses when data processing fails
  - Add clear error messages for common issues (no data, invalid queries, etc.)
  - Create helpful guidance for users when queries can't be processed
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6_

- [x] 7. Create integration tests for data flow

  - Write tests to verify CSV upload → table display → chat query → dashboard update flow
  - Test that data view remains intact when chat responses are processed
  - Verify conversational responses are generated correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.6, 2.6, 3.7_

- [x] 8. Add loading states and user feedback
  - Implement proper loading indicators during data processing
  - Add progress feedback for long-running operations
  - Ensure smooth transitions between different states
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_
